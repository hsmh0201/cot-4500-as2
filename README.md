# cot-4500-as2

This repository is python coding for multiple numerical interpolation meathods - nevilles method, newtons forward interpolation, hermite polynomial and cubic spline interpolation. Multiple libraries are used in this implementation so a requirements.txt file is given for installation. NumPy for numerical computations and matrix operations, SymPy for symbolic computation in Newtons method and decimal for high percision arithmetic for nevilles method. For running th code the script is "python main.py".
